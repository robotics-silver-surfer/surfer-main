Attention Fellow Classmates! 

There is an issue when copying files to a different directory from when they were made.  
In order to solve this problem, you can either run "rosmake --pre-clean"  any time you checkout someones new files, or, the better solution, we all create the same directory to our packages.  

My projects are now currently stored in /projects/ros/

To Checkout the files intially (Assuming Git is already setup) 

"git clone https://github.com/robotics-silver-surfer/surfer-main.git"

After intial checkout use 

"git checkout" to checkout files
and 
"git commit" to checkin files
